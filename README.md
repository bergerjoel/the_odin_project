# the_odin_project

<p>In this repository I track my step-by-step progress following the "Foundations" course of <strong>The Odin Project</strong>.<br> 
The website of <strong>The Odin Project</strong> can be found here: <em>www.theodinproject.com</em><br> 
Listed below are the components of my journey through the course, added in chronological order.</p>

### html_boilerplate
<p>This folder contains a basic 'index.html' with a 'DOCTYPE' and some (un-)ordered list elements.</p>

### links_and_images
<p>This folder contains a basic 'index.html' and a folder 'pages' with an 'about.html'.<br>
Some absolute and relative links are tested using the 'anchor' element. An image is inserted and its source deliberatly broken to test the 'alt' attribute of HTML.</p>

### recipes
<p>Next one to be done.</p>
