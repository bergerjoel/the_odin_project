# the_odin_project

<p>In this repository I track my step-by-step progress following the <strong>Foundations</strong> course of <a href="www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>.<br> 
Listed below are the components of my journey through the course, added in chronological order.</p><br> 

### HTML Foundations:
<ul>
<li><strong>"html_boilerplate"</strong> <em>(from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-html-boilerplate">HTML Boilerplate</a>)</em>:
<p>This folder contains a basic 'index.html' with a 'DOCTYPE' and some (un-)ordered list elements.</p></li>

<li><strong>"links_and_images"</strong> <em>(from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-links-and-images">Links and Images</a>)</em>:
<p>This folder contains a basic 'index.html' and a folder 'pages' with an 'about.html'.<br>
Some absolute and relative links are tested using the 'anchor' element. An image is inserted and its source deliberatly broken to test the 'alt' attribute of HTML.</p></li>

<li><strong>"recipes"</strong> <em>(from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes">Project: Recipes</a>)</em>:
<p>This folder contains four different HTML files: One 'index.html' and three others ('salad.html', 'bowl.html', 'borscht.html'), containing information on three different recipes found at <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/">Allrecipes</a>. Yet there are no CSS files added making the site more nice. So far this is just an exploration of how to link different pages together correctly.</p></li>
