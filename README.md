# top_HTML

This repository tracks my step-by-step progress following the _HTML Foundations_ course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Listed below are the components added in chronological order.
> For my fork of the following _CSS Foundations_ please go [here](https://github.com/bergerjoel/top_css-exercises/tree/main).

## HTML Foundations:

[html_boilerplate](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-html-boilerplate) contains a basic `index.html` with a DOCTYPE and some (un-)ordered list elements.

[links_and_images](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-links-and-images) contains a basic `index.html` and a folder `pages` with an `about.html`. Some absolute and relative links are tested using the `anchor` element. An image is inserted and its source deliberatly broken to test the `alt` attribute of HTML.

[recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) contains four different HTML files: One 'index.html' and three others (`salad.html`, `bowl.html`, `borscht.html`), containing information on three different recipes found at [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/). Yet there are no CSS files added making the site more nice. So far this is just an exploration of how to link different pages together correctly.
